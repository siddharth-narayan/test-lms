$$\dfrac{A}{\Phi} \Pi \pi= A$$

The way to do this is $a=\dfrac{1}{2}$

Magnetic Fields are the same as Electric fields. They have a very similar set of laws, and their strength is proportional to $r^2$ as usual

# Cross Products
$$\vec{A}\times\vec{B}=|\vec{A}|\cdot|\vec{B}|\cdot cos(\theta)$$
To find the result, use the right hand rule
### The Right Hand Rule
pointer finger is $\vec{v}$, middle finger is $\vec{B}$, and Thumb is resultant. Resultant is always perpendicular to both vectors in a cross product.

# Ampere's Law

$$ \oint \vec{B} \space\cdot\space d\vec{l} = \mu_0I_{enc}$$

We can calculate the magnetic field magnitude at a radius $r$ from a straight wire by imaging a loop around the wire with the same radius $r$. The direction of $\vec{B}$ will always be in the exact same direction as $d\vec{l}$, so we can simplify the equation to

$$
B\oint\vec{dl}=\mu_0I_{enc} 
\implies B \cdot 2\pi r = \mu_0I_{enc} 
\implies B = \dfrac{\mu_0I_{enc}}{2\pi r}
$$

This does *not* calculate flux.


# Biot-Savart Law
$$\vec{B}(\vec{r}) = \dfrac{\mu_0}{4\pi}\dfrac{q\vec{v} \times \hat{r}}{r^2}$$Where:
- $q$ is the charge of the particle
- $\vec{v}$ is the velocity of the particle
- $\hat{r}$ is the unit vector pointing to the observation point
- $\vec{r}$ is the vector to the observation point

# Lenz's Law
Lenz's Law relates the change in magnetic field to the current induced in a loop of wire
